# Traco

Translatable columns for Rails 3, stored in the model table itself.

Inspired by Iain Hecker's [translatable_columns](https://github.com/iain/translatable_columns/).

To store translations outside the model, see Sven Fuchs' [globalize3](https://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3).


## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'traco', github: 'barsoom/traco'

Then run

    bundle

to install it.


## Usage

The columns to translate should exist in the database with locale suffixes, e.g. `title_sv` and `title_en`.

Declare these columns in the model:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      translates :title, :body
    end

You can still use the `title_sv` accessors in forms and other code, but you also get:

`#title`:  Show the title in the current locale. If blank, fall back to default locale, then to any locale.

`#title=`: Assign the title to the column for the current locale, if present. Raise if the column doesn't exist.

`#human_attribute_name(:title_sv)`: Returns "Title (Swedish)" if you have a translation key `i18n.languages.sv = "Swedish"` and "Title (SV)" otherwise.

And the equivalent methods for `body`, of course.

Note that ActiveRecord validations check against the reader method, so if you validate for presence of `title`, it will check in the current locale.
You can validate against the localized columns like `title_sv` if you want.


<!-- Keeping this a hidden brain dump for now.

## TODO

We've intentionally kept this simple with no features we do not need.
We'd be happy to merge additional features that others contribute.

Possible improvements to make:

  * Validation that checks that at least one translation for a column exists.
  * Validation that checks that every translation for a column exists.
  * Option to disable fallback.
  * Class method `.translatable_columns(:title) => [ :title_sv, :title_en ]`
    to loop over columns to render a form.
  * Scopes like `translated`, `translated_to(locale)`.
  * Support for region locales, like `en-US` and `en-GB`.
  * Support other things than ActiveRecord models, like Rails helpers,
    [drapers](https://github.com/jcasimir/draper) and POROs.
